The imperial cult was inescapable in Paul’s world. Its traditions were carried out in private homes and based on common household rituals. Its celebrations and sacrifices littered the calendars of cities and provinces across the empire and its temples embodied the majesty ascribed to the emperor. Though the official position paid honor to deceased emperors, rituals performed outside of the city limits of Rome served to honor the living emperor. The people who heard and read Paul’s letters certainly would have been familiar with the rituals and words of the imperial cult. The remainder of this dissertation will compare words and phrases from the imperial cult that also appear in Paul’s letters, seeking to understand how the original recipients would have understood those words in their context.
