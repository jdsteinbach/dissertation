The Roman imperial cult used divine titles to portray the emperor as a benefactor who cared for and provided for his empire. This use of divine titles can be traced as far back as the Egyptian belief that the Pharoah was responsible to provide protection and prosperity for his nation. Nearly twenty different Greek words ascribe benevolent provision to the emperor. The most prominent titles of benevolence from the imperial cult that also appear regularly in Paul’s epistles are σωτήρ and εὐαγγέλιον. This chapter will examine the use of cognates of both words in both the imperial cult and Paul’s letters, concluding that while the imperial cult provides helpful context for understanding Paul’s letters, the available evidence does not suggest that Paul used these titles in a politically subversive way.
