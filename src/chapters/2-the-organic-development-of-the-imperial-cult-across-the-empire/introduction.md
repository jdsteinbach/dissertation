The student of Roman history should not denigrate the value of understanding the official Roman conception of imperial cult as approved by the Senate and emperor and implemented in and around Rome. A truer measure of the impact the cult made on Paul’s world, however, is the role that emperor worship played in provinces, cities, and homes across the empire. In many cases, the common expression of the cult differed significantly from the cult’s official Roman formulation. Differences between Roman policy and ordinary practice stand in especially sharp relief in the eastern part of the empire. If Price’s hypothesis that the imperial cult was less about religion and more about politics, the cult may have been directed deliberately toward the East, formulated in part as a way of helping the formerly independent Greek city-states relate to a new centralized power.
