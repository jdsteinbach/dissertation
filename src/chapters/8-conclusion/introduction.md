This dissertation set out to answer the question “To what extent does Paul borrow the vocabulary and ideology of the Roman imperial cult as he describes Jesus in his letters?” The pursuit of that answer began with an examination of the development and expressions of the imperial cult in first-century Rome. That part of the study revealed that Rome’s official development of the cult was careful and restrained, while the eastern embrace of the cult was enthusiastic and less restrained. For a specific point of comparison between the imperial cult and Pauline Christology, the rest of this dissertation examined honorific titles used in both systems. The respective uses of these titles from first-century Greek literature and from Paul’s epistles were analyzed individually and compared for similarity of both syntax and thought. These comparisons revealed that although Paul occasionally honored Jesus with the same titles used to honor the emperors, Paul’s use of those titles often had more in common with Old Testament occurrences of the titles than with imperial cult usage. Furthermore, Paul’s use of these shared titles did not pose any threat (direct or veiled) to imperial authority.
