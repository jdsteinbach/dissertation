Paul regularly describes Jesus with words and titles that also serve to honor the emperor in first-century Greek literature. In some of these parallels, the Greco-Roman use of the title provides helpful background to Pauline use. In other comparisons, both Paul and the imperial cult draw from a common use of the title, but develop divergent meanings in their own contexts. In yet other cases, Paul and the imperial cult use the same words in the same way, but present their honorees as rulers of differing spheres. None of the words studied in this dissertation appear to be subversive or anti-imperial in Paul’s letters. Paul’s letters certainly set Jesus as the Lord of a higher realm than the Roman Empire, and his commitment to Jesus’ exclusive deity certainly precluded participation in emperor-centered idolatry. These implications of the lordship of Jesus, however, do not constitute a rhetorical assault on the imperial government or a call to political revolution. The words of Modica and McKnight conclude this study well: “The New Testament conclusion that Jesus is Lord, Caesar is not, is not a direct assault on the Roman Empire or even a veiled attempt to usurp it. Rather, to claim that Jesus is Lord is to place oneself in the servitude of a radically different kingdom—one which has no equal, now and forever.” [_Jesus Is Lord, Caesar Is Not: Evaluating Empire in New Testament Studies_ (Downers Grove: IVP Academic, 2012), 214]
