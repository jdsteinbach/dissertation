The titles σωτήρ and εὐαγγέλιον, along with their cognates, are shared by Paul’s epistles and the Roman imperial cult. At times, understanding the Roman ideas behind these words helps in the interpretation of Paul’s letters. Cultural background for σωτήρ provides a starting place for understanding Jesus’ work of delivering his people from danger. Understanding the function of the imperial εὐαγγέλιον as an accession announcement sheds light on Paul’s teaching on obedience to the gospel.

The components of meaning shared by the imperial cult and Paul’s letters do not provide adequate grounds for interpreting Paul’s use of these titles as politically charged propaganda. The eternal salvation that Jesus provides does not conflict with the emperor’s temporal salvation. The good news about Jesus does not present him as a competitor to Caesar’s rule, but as a sacrificial provider of spiritual benefits. Paul’s use of both word groups is clearly in Old Testament prophecies that identify Yahweh as savior and as subject of good news. Thus Paul’s use of the σωτήρ and εὐαγγέλιον word groups serves to identify Jesus with Yahweh, not to position him as a challenger to the emperor.
