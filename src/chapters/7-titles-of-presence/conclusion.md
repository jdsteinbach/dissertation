The words ἐπιφάνεια (and cognates) and παρουσία both refer to one’s presence, often used of a dignitary or leader. Ἐπιφάνεια emphasizes the appearance of the one present, referring either to the external appearance of the subject or to the act of his appearing. Παρουσία emphasizes the physical presence of its subject, referring either to his state of being present or to his act of arriving. Both these words appear infrequently with imperial referents and both play an important part in Paul’s theology of Jesus’ return.

Paul’s use of ἐπιφάνεια runs parallel to certain secular uses. As a general or leader making an ἐπιφάνεια often brought deliverance and relief to his subjects, Paul anticipates the ἐπιφάνεια of Jesus as an event at which he brings deliverance and relief to his people (II&nbsp;Tim.&nbsp;4.8; Tit.&nbsp;2.13). He also predicts that Jesus will prevail with military victory at his appearance (II&nbsp;Thess.&nbsp;2.8). Paul is not bound merely to parrot Greco-Roman usage, however. He uses ἐπιφάνεια to communicate the accountability that God’s servants will experience at Jesus’ appearance. This theme is strong in the teachings of Jesus, but does not appear frequently in Greek literature. Paul exalts the Father for his sovereign control over the timing of Jesus’ ἐπιφάνεια. While a Roman official’s appearance may have been governed by his superior, the emperor would not have answered to anyone else.

Paul’s use of παρουσία likewise bears both similarities to and differences from the Roman usage. Like ἐπιφάνεια, παρουσία appears to take its basic Pauline meaning from the arrivals of dignitaries in the Greek and Roman empires. The eager anticipation that he conveys to his readers reflects the honor of a Roman city visited by the emperor or one of his emissaries. Paul calls his readers to look for Jesus’ παρουσία during difficulties and to live so that he will find them obedient at his arrival. Unlike the normal Roman use, Paul connects the παρουσία of Jesus to the beginning of unfettered enjoyment of resurrection life for his people. The arrival of Jesus also marks the completion of God’s sanctifying work in his people’s lives. Neither of these ideas have any counterpart in secular or imperial cult usage of παρουσία.

Both ἐπιφάνεια and παρουσία have wide ranges of non-imperial meaning. Even in the sense that most resembles imperial use, each word appears with multiple non-imperial referents in Greek literature. Since these words did not belong exclusively to the imperial cult, Paul’s use of them ought not be construed as subversive or anti-imperial.
