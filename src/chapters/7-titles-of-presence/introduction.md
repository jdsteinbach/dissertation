The presence of the emperor would have brought great honor to a town in the Roman Empire. Citizens treated an imperial visit accordingly and spoke of the emperor’s presence with honorific words. The two most prominent honorific words relating to the presence of the emperor are ἐπιφάνεια and παροuσία. These synonyms emphasize both the splendor of his appearance and occasion of his arrival. Each section of this chapter will begin with an examination of the imperial use of one of these words in first-century Greek literature.

Paul uses both ἐπιφάνεια and παρουσία with reference to Jesus as well. These words appear most frequently in the Thessalonian letters and pastoral epistles, featuring prominently in eschatological sections of these letters. Comparing Paul’s use of ἐπιφάνεια and παρουσία to the secular first-century use will reveal the degree to which Paul borrowed imperial meaning and show that he did not use these words to subvert the Roman emperor.
