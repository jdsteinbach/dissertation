From the time of Alexander the Great and other Greek leaders to the Roman emperors ruling during Paul’s life, the bestowal of divine honors upon prominent leaders happened on a regular basis. Not every divine honor, however, indicated a direct equation of its recipient with absolute deity. The emperors’ ability to accept or refuse honors offered by the Senate or citizens reveals that the imperial cult honored its recipients as something less than what a monotheist would call “God.” The pattern of sharing honors with another Roman deity also indicates that the Roman imperial cult treated the emperors as something more than man, but less than absolute deity. Gradel labels this “relative divinity,” arguing that Romans viewed the emperor as a man with “divine status,” as opposed to believing him actually to be a god. Julius Caesar is the only emperor to be deified by the Senate during his lifetime; all his successors who were deified received that honor posthumously. The imperial cult was not a theological system purporting the emperor to be a god; it was a system of rituals and honors treating the emperor as one with uniquely elevated status.

This chapter explains the official development of the imperial cult in Rome itself. As noted above, the rest of the empire did not necessarily act in accordance with official decrees, and there were subtle nuances of each emperor’s acceptance and refusal of certain honors. For this reason, the next chapter will attempt to describe the unofficial practice of emperor worship in province, towns, and homes across the empire. Visualizing the common man’s experience with emperor worship will provide a clearer understanding of the historical context in which Paul communicated the humility and majesty of Christ.
