Few titles are used as commonly for Jesus as “Lord,” yet few escape real scrutiny today as much as “Lord” does. The blame for this taking for granted of the title “Lord” surely does not lie with the Scripture writers. Paul used this title with great meaning. The title “Lord” also grew into important usage in the Roman imperial cult. The comparison of the two uses of this title and an examination of several synonyms relating to lordship will provide a clearer answer to the question, “To what degree did Paul borrow honorific titles for Jesus from the imperial cult?”
