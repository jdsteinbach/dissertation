While the Greek words εἰρήνη (peace) and ἀσφάλεια (security) are not technically titles, their function within the imperial cult and in one of Paul’s letters has earned them a place of prominence in contemporary scholarship and in this dissertation. Some authors have called this phrase a “slogan” of imperial propaganda. To properly evaluate this claim, it will be necessary to identify the role that each of these words played in both the imperial cult and Pauline Christology. After surveying broad and specific usage of each word individually, this chapter will examine the collocate occurrences of εἰρήνη and ἀσφάλεια to ascertain whether they can be identified accurately as a “slogan” and to understand what impact that identification has on conclusions about Paul’s potentially anti-imperial use of this phrase in I&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;5.3.
