The edge gained by uncovering the historical background to Scripture cuts two ways. On one hand, historical background adds focus, clarity, and accuracy to the reader’s knowledge of the biblical text. On the other hand, historical research presents a unique challenge to interpretation. Not all background information has equal bearing on exegesis; therefore, the student must discriminate among the data, setting aside what connects tangentially to the text and keeping what directly influences interpretation.

The dilemma affects a current trend in the interpretation of Paul’s writings: the relationship of his epistles to the imperial cult in first‑century Rome. As more information about early emperor worship comes to light, the allurement to relate Paul’s letters to this fresh data becomes more irresistible. Resisting novelty merely for the sake of tradition or conservatism does not serve the text, the interpreter, or the Church. A cautious evaluation of the evidence, however, will provide two key benefits: it will safeguard against errors that stem from an uncritical use of historical data and it will improve theology with accurately evaluated background information.
