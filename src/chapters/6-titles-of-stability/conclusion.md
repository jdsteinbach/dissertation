Paul’s use of εἰρήνη and ἀσφάλεια in Christological contexts reveals a different view of peace and security than the one offered by the Roman Empire. The peace that Paul ascribes to Jesus is not military or political; rather, it begins with the creation of peace between a sinner and God, then fosters peaceful relationships among believers. Imperial propaganda emphasized peace from hostile armies and criminals; Jesus’ peace does not supplant the safe conditions created by wise imperial rule. Furthermore, Paul’s quotations from the prophets and greetings using _shalom_ indicate that the Old Testament provides the primary context for interpreting these words in his letters.

Paul’s sole use of ἀσφάλεια follows no pattern in imperial usage because no such imperial pattern appears to have existed. Ἀσφάλεια receives close attention because of its collocation with εἰρήνη in I&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;5.3. Contrary to some contemporary authors, that phrase does not appear to function as an imperial slogan in either Greek or Latin literature. While peace and security both played a role in imperial propaganda, their combined occurrence in this verse does not necessarily constitute a “frontal attack” on the emperor. On the contrary, in Pauline usage, these words operate in spiritual realms and present no overt challenge to the Roman emperor.
