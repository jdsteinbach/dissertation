One of the primary ways in which any system of worship reveres its honorees is the use of special titles. Unique titles indicate unique character, nature, or position. Honorific titles serve two purposes: to elevate their recipient and to communicate specific reasons why the recipient deserves to be elevated. Honorific titles for the emperor were prominent in first century Rome. The special labels given to the emperors often had their roots in Egyptian or Greek history. These titles serve as an optimal means for studying the imperial cult because of their substantial historical attestation. While rituals would also be helpful in understanding the cult, they often are recorded only in images or anecdotes: no comprehensive guide for worshiping the emperor exists. A ruler’s titles and name, on the other hand, often appeared stamped on coins, inscribed in statues, and recorded in history. This availability makes honorific titles a useful tool for understanding the Roman imperial cult.

Of course, the New Testament authors assigned many titles of honor to Jesus as well. Several of these titles and words closely related to them appear in both the New Testament and the historical evidence of the imperial cult. The remainder of this dissertation will examine those titles and phrases that are common to both emperor worship and Pauline Christology. By examining the historical context of the emperors’ titles and the theological context of Paul’s letters, the remaining chapters will seek to answer the question, “To what extent did Paul borrow honorific titles and their meanings from the imperial cult?”

The first category of titles to be examined is titles relating to divinity. This category includes the titles “God” (θεός) and “Son of God” (υἱὸς θεοῦ). This chapter will treat these two titles individually, defining their meaning in the imperial cult, explaining their use and significance in Pauline theology, and comparing the two spheres of meaning for similarities and dissimilarities.
